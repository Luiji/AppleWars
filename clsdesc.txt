BUILDING RETRO VIDEO GAMES

Do you remember Mario back when he was pixelated and could only move in four directions? How about when Sonic was a decent series? Ever wondered how these games worked?

Come to BUILDING RETRO VIDEO GAMES and I'll teach you about the guts of these old games:

* Sprites: the player, enemies and coins
* Tile Maps: the ground, walls and water
* Collision Detection: why everything doesn't just fall through the floor
* And more!

In the end we will have constructed a basic game of our own, displaying how all this stuff works. I will have tought you how these games work and how to make a simple one by yourself using the LÃ–VE video game engine.

PREREQUISITES

Basic algebra, an interest in 2-D video games and a little patience. I will be teaching you some basic computer programming, so you should be able to see code and not freak out. Its not as complicated as it looks, I promise!
